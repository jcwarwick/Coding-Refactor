# Coding-Refactor

I edited the factors in the HTMl and CSS document to make the code cleaner. as well as adding comments inside the code as i went. mostly replacing divs with more properly labbled tags, adn combining redundant classes. 

in this project i changed all the items in HTML given div with items that made more sense to someone looking from the outside in and combined items inside the CSS to eliminate repeating elements
